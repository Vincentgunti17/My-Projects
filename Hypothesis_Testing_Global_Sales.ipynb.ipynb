    "    * Define a problem statement to investigate with either t-test or z-test.\n",
    "    * Describe your dataset, including the columns that will support our analysis.\n",
    "2) Describe your test approach\n",
    "    * Justify your selection of which test you will use. \n",

    "3) Conduct your analysis according to your defined parameters above.\n",
    "    * Include a descriptive analysis as appropriate\n",
    "    * Prep your data for analysis\n",

    "Based on the initial overview of the dataset from a shoe company, here's a proposed scenario and problem statement for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "The dataset represents sales data from an international shoe company. This company operates in multiple countries and offers a range of shoe products catering to different genders. Their business model includes both full-priced and discounted sales, which can be vital for understanding purchasing trends and consumer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "A key question for the company could be to understand if there is a statistically significant difference in the average sales price between discounted and non-discounted shoes. Such insights could inform future pricing and discount strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset includes the following relevant columns for our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Country**: Location of the sale, which could be interesting for geographical analysis.\n",
    "2. **Gender**: The gender for which the shoe is designed.\n",
    "3. **Size (US), Size (Europe), Size (UK)**: Different sizing standards, useful for regional analysis.\n",
    "4. **UnitPrice**: The original price of the shoe.\n",
    "5. **Discount**: The percentage discount applied to the shoe.\n",
    "6. **SalePrice**: The final price of the shoe after applying the discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed with the analysis, we will focus on the `Discount` and `SalePrice` columns. We can use a t-test or z-test to compare the mean SalePrice between discounted and non-discounted shoes. The choice between a t-test and a z-test would depend on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to proceed with this analysis, or is there a different aspect of the data you're interested in exploring?"

    "### Test Approach Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Selection Justification\n",
    "I chose the **independent t-test** for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective of the Analysis**: The goal is to compare the means of two independent groups (discounted vs. non-discounted shoes) to determine if there is a significant difference in their average sale prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size**: Both groups have large sample sizes (discounted shoes: 6,680; non-discounted shoes: 8,296). While large samples might often suggest a z-test, the t-test is more versatile as it does not require the population standard deviation, which is unknown in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Characteristics**: The t-test is appropriate when comparing the means of two independent samples, which is exactly our scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness**: The t-test is robust for large samples, making it a suitable choice even when the sample size is well above the typical threshold for 'large' samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses Definition\n",
    "To support the problem statement, the following hypothesis couplet (H0/H1) is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in the average sale price between discounted and non-discounted shoes. Mathematically, this can be stated as: \\( H_0: \\mu_{\\text{discounted}} = \\mu_{\\text{non-discounted}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a difference in the average sale price between discounted and non-discounted shoes. This can be represented as: \\( H_1: \\mu_{\\text{discounted}} \\neq \\mu_{\\text{non-discounted}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, we are testing for any difference (higher or lower) in the average sale prices, making it a two-tailed test. The p-value obtained from the test will indicate the probability of observing the data assuming the null hypothesis is true. A very low p-value (as we obtained) leads us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, suggesting a significant difference in the average sale prices between the two groups."
